// Problem Statement: You are given ‘N’ roses and you are also given an array ‘arr’  where ‘arr[i]’  denotes that the ‘ith’ rose will bloom on the ‘arr[i]th’ day.
// You can only pick already bloomed roses that are adjacent to make a bouquet. You are also told that you require exactly ‘k’ adjacent bloomed roses to make a single bouquet.
// Find the minimum number of days required to make at least ‘m’ bouquets each containing ‘k’ roses. Return -1 if it is not possible.

// Examples
// Example 1:
// Input Format: N = 8, arr[] = {7, 7, 7, 7, 13, 11, 12, 7}, m = 2, k = 3
// Result: 12
// Explanation: On the 12th the first 4 flowers and the last 3 flowers would have already bloomed. So, we can easily make 2 bouquets, one with the first 3 and another with the last 3 flowers.

// Example 2:
// Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {1, 10, 3, 10, 2}, m = 3, k = 2
// Result: -1
// Explanation: If we want to make 3 bouquets of 2 flowers each, we need at least 6 flowers. But we are given only 5 flowers, so, we cannot make the bouquets.


// Let's grasp the question better with the help of an example. Consider an array: {7, 7, 7, 7, 13, 11, 12, 7}. We aim to create bouquets with k, which is 3 adjacent flowers, and we need to make m, which is 2 such bouquets. 
//Now, if we try to make bouquets on the 11th day, the first 4 flowers and the 6th and the last flowers would have bloomed. So, we will be having 6 flowers in total on the 11th day. However, we require two groups of 3 adjacent flowers each. 
//Although we can form one group with the first 3 adjacent flowers, we cannot create a second group. Therefore, 11 is not the answer in this case.
// If we choose the 12th day, we can make 2 such groups, one with the first 3 adjacent flowers and the other with the last 3 adjacent flowers. Hence, we need a minimum of 12 days to make 2 bouquets.
